      We will never send anything other than a <code>txt</code> file
      as part of your daily backups. To protect yourself against phishing attacks, never open
      any other kind of file, and always open the <code>txt</code> file with a text editor to
      verify its contents before decrypting.

      We will never include clickable links in this email. Instead, manually verify
