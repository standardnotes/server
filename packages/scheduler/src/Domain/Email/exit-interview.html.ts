    We're truly sad to see you leave. Our mission is simple: build the best, most private, and most secure
    note-taking app available. It's clear we've fallen short of your expectations somewhere along the way.

    We just want you to know—if price was the reason you canceled, we're not willing to lose you. That's no issue
    for us and we're happy to work out something that fits better with your budget. If price is your primary
    concern, please click the link below, and we'll get in touch with some options.

    If you canceled for another reason, such as a missing feature, or a feature that wasn't behaving or working as
    you expected, please let us know! We build this product for you, and feedback from customers like yourself who
    are willing to pay for a product is most crucial for us as we continue to evolve and iterate on Standard
    Notes.

    Our team reads every single response, and your feedback will be shared with the relevant department within our
    team.
